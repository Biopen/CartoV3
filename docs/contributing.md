Never work in master or dev branch.

Always create a branch for your specific purpose (exple : "feature-share", or relative to particuliar issue : "issue-#456-bug-in-geocoder")

When you're done with your work, create a pull request from your branch to
the branch "dev"

The dev branch will only be merged into master for milestones.

Please comment as possible your work !
