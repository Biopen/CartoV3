Overview
--------

We are developing a collaborative mapping directory app.

The main functionalities are
- Displaying data entries
- Free and smooth navigation on the map
- Filter the results, search for a particular location or data
- Ability to everyone to contribute adding/editing/deleting data
- Export data service (API and IFrame)

First we gonna  develop this directory for the project "Pr√®s de chez vous", consisting on mapping food/education/health/... alternatives in France.

Then the goal is to make this application accessible to everyone, with a configuration panel to fit their needs.
